v0.26
-----

Fixes and Features:
- Fixed a small bug in the debug version, as the horizontal cycles was not 
  showing up correctly.
- Fixed transparency so that it is disabled if the register $2130 disables all 
  color math.
  (Fixes the screw up in Aladdin)
- Fix code skip for WAI/STP/WDM instructions so that if the player does not 
  enable HDMA through the Snezziboy configuration, then the code skip selects 
  the fastest skipping mode.
- Fixed a critical bug in the mechanism that supports the intra-frame 
  update of background scroll position. The bug, which crashes the emulator at
  worst, or screws up some layers at best, only occurs after about 65535 SNES 
  frames have been completely rendered, or roughly 18 minutes into gameplay, 
  assuming the game runs at full 60 fps without slowdown.


v0.25
-----

Fixes and Features:
- Fixed a bug with the reading of registers $2137/$213C/$213D
  (Final Fantasy Mystic Quest is able to proceed to the title screen)
- Fixed a critical bug with the MVN/MVP instructions to handle the A register
  correctly in 8-bit mode.
- Fixed a DMA bug so that the incrementing of the source address does not
  affect the address bank.
  (Final Fantasy Mystic no longer crashes and now seems playable)
- Fixed a bug with the DMA transfer to correctly increment the source address 
  depending on the DMA increment mode.
  (Secret of Mana no longer crashes before the first dungeon)
- Fixed a bug with the RESET function that causes backgrounds remain 
  stationary after using the configuration's RESET option.
- Fixed the SBC instruction to take care of decimal mode subtraction 
  (uses modified code from SNES Advance)
  (Zombies ate my Neighbors is now playable)
- Fixed Mode 7 where there was once a band appearing at the top of the screen.
- Fixed (partially) SNES additive transparencies.
- Implemented Mode 7 wraparound based on register $211A.


HDMA:
- Implemented partial HDMA for background scrolling positions
  (Donkey Kong 3, first level moves as expected)
  (Street Fighter 2 background moves as expected)
  (Castlevania X first level background effects visible)
  (HDMA is slow on the GBA and is expected)
- Implemented new option to enable/disable HDMA
  (for games that don't necessarily require it)

Optimizations:
- Made slight optimizations to instructions that operate on the A register,
  and certain jump instructions
- Made major optimizations to all instructions to remove instruction to add to 
  SnesPC register 
  (Credit to Gladius for the suggestion; most games should experience 
  a slight but notable increase in speed)


v0.24 (Quick Fix Release)
-----

Fixes and Features:
- Quick fixed a minor problem in the header detection algorithm in the 
  Snezziboy builder. (This may require a more proper fix later...)
- Fixed a bug with the XCE code that was emulated wrongly.
- Fixed the VRAM allocation so that Illusion of Gaia works correctly again.
- Remove the wraparound bug that causes clones of Samus' ship during the
  Super Metroid demo.


v0.23
-----

Fixes and Features:

- Fixed a critical bug with the register reads and writes (might be slower)
- Improved cycle counting (again) for block move and DMA operations.
- Added feature to handle mid-frame change of background offsets.
  (Able to see water in Super Mario World,
  Able to see scrolling clouds in Super Mario All Stars: Super Mario Bros, 
  Able to see fixed status panel in Super Mario All Stars: Super Mario Bros 3, 
  Able to see scrolling name entry in Zelda: A Link to the Past)
- Fixed reading register $4212 to indicate auto-joypad read status.
- Fixed writing register $4016 to reset only when the correct bit is set.
- Fixed joypad registers to send joypad input only from the first controller.
- Fixed HiROM mapping.
- Added Mode 20/21 ROM Access Speed.
- Fixed a bug with the INC/DEC opcode that was previously returning the wrong
  flags.
  (This fixes Super Mario Bros 2's glitch where the character suddenly warps to the
  top of the screen)
- Fixed messed up colors when in 256-color palettes.
- Fixed fading to use always the brightest fade color per frame
- Slightly improved VRAM allocation for background graphics
- Implemented Mode 7 Graphics


- Added more configuration options:
  o FORCED BG MODE
      AUTO, MODE 1, MODE 2,... MODE 7
  o VRAM BG ALLOC
      SMART - Don't allocate for disabled BGs 
              may see less garbled graphics,
              slow refresh on every enabling/disabling/flicker of BGs
      FAST  - Allocate for disabled BGs
              may see more garbled graphics
              fast flickering of BGs (needed by games like Megaman 7)
  o VRAM OBJ ALLOC
      SHARED - Shared with BGs (may result in less space for BG graphics)
      EXCLUSIVE - Not shared with BGs (allows more space for BG graphics)

- Added Quick Configuration Feature:
  o L+R+SELECT+UP: Cycle through the following BG Priority Sets
      set 1 = (P1, P2, P0, P3)
      set 2 = (P2, P1, P0, P3)
      set 3 = (P0, P1, P2, P3)
      set 4 = (P1, P0, P2, P3)

  o L+R+SELECT+DOWN: Cycle through the FORCED BG MODEs
      opt 0 = as required by game
      opt 1-7 = the respective modes


v0.22
----

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed the JMP ($xxxx) and the JML [$xxxx] instruction to read the indirect addresses from bank zero
  instead of the current data bank.
  (Aero fighters now work)
- Shifted the horizontal offset by 8 pixels to the right so games now look generally centralized
- Modified the IO for WRAM write at IO addresses $2180-3 to behave as Snes9x

  pop the correct program counter from the stack.
  (Earthworm Jim now works)
- Fixed the $213C/D registers to generate the H/V counters correctly.
  (Zelda-A Link to the Past now works, though in the name entry screen, the name selection still
  does not move, and in-game text is invisible...)
- Fixed the COP instruction to fire a COP interrupt
  (Illusion of Gaia now intros correctly)
- Fixed the MVP/MVN instruction to increment the cycle counter correctly.
- Fixed the DMA such that source DMA address is incremented and the DMA size is set to 0,
  after each DMA channel read/write is complete.
  (Contra's intro and in-game background tiles display correctly now)
  (FF2 non-mode 7 backgrounds now displays correctly)
  (Illusion of Gaia title screens appear)
- Added rendering for Modes 4 and 5.
  (Secret of Mana name entry screen requires mode 5, and now appears better. Due to
  double horizontal resolution though, the text appears but remains unreadable)
- Added the $2139/A registers to read the VRAM.
  (Illusion of Gaia seems to works perfectly)
  (MegamanX, Megaman7 screens get restored after pressing start)
- Added option for enabling backdrop
  (With this option set to Yes, Super Mario World backgrounds will not appear black)

Others:

  speed hacks, SPC patches and other patches.


v0.21 
----

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed the TSC instruction so that the C register is updated regardless if M bit.
- Fixed the TDC instruction so that the C register is updated regardless if M bit.
- Fixed the RTL/RTS/RTI instructions so that it can properly return from the subroutine
  that had been JSL/JSR-ed from $xx:8000
- Made fixes in the memory map for games with no SRAM size, so that ROMs that try
  to detect for absence of SRAM (protection against copying) will get what they expect.
  (Bust-a-move makes it to the main screen, but the game itself is unplayable due to
  the use of HDMA)
- Made fixes to the $DB (modified STP instruction) to jump correctly. 
  (Tetris Attack now works)
- Fixed the PEI instruction; it was previously pushing $0000 always onto the stack
- Fixed BIT instruction to update the N/Z flags correctly when BIT-ing in a non-immediate mode.

- Fixed bug with VRAM writing
  (Darius Twin's in-game screen no longer garbles-up randomly)

Known Issues:

- Breath of Fire I keeps flickering, and runs very slowly.
- For some reason, sprites seem to be 'flickering' on many games.

- Fixed the IO for WRAM write at IO addresses $2180-3
  (Megaman7 sprites now appear)
- Incorporated SNES Advance's SBC/ADC accurate implementations

  (MegamanX, Megaman7 runs faster)
- Fixed 256 color background update (for mode 3)
  (Super Mario All-Stars title and menu selection now visible, 
  Super Mario Bros, The Lost Worlds subgames entirely playable with appropriate speed patch)
