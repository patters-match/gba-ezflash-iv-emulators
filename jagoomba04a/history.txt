https://www.dwedit.org/dwedit_board/viewtopic.php?id=637
   Rewrote GBC's DMA feature, much faster now

   Rewrote VRAM system again, faster
   Speedhacks for the engine used by Wayforward's games: Shantae, Wendy Every Witch Way, Sabrina Spooked, Sabrina Zapped, and WWF Betrayal:
     - The RNG routine, called each frame, was ported to ARM asm (HUGE SPEEDUP)
     - Sabrina Zapped uses a different RNG, I haven't ported that yet
     - The most frequently executed Z80 code was also ported to ARM asm
     - Streamlined reduce unnecessary VRAM copying
     - Shantae now runs at 50-60fps compared to 27fps before
