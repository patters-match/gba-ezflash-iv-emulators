EZ-FLASH IV QUICK TUTORIAL
EZ4Client is no longer needed after EZ4 Kernel 2.00

UPDATE FIRMWARE
Download the newest firmware from EZ-FLASH official site and extract it to the root folder of SD card.
Power up GBA/NDS with R key pressed, the card will go to the firmware upgrade procedure automatically.
The new kernel will boot after the upgrade finished, please check the version on the top right corner of the desktop.
You can delete the ezfla_up.bin safely.

SETUP
Choose the third icon on the desktop. the first option is language setting. you can select between Chinese and English. The second option is deprecated.

LAUNCH GAME
Choose the first icon on the desktop, go to the EZDISK folder, the gamesgame on the SD card will be listed there. there are TWO mode for different game and circumstances.

PSRAM MODE
This mode is working with game size <= 16Mb, though it loads fast but it needs loading time every time.
In the game browser, just press A key will launch the game in PSRAM MODE.

NORFLASH MODE
This mode is working with all sizes of game, it needs longer time to write the game to the NORFLASH, but it launches game like a flash every time. You can write multiple games in the NORFLASH with total size no more than 32Mb. For example: 4 x 8Mbit, 2 x 16Mbits, 1 x 16Mbit + 2 x 8Mbit.... PLEASE DO NOT USE TRIMMED GAME IN NORFLASH MODE!!

In the game browser, press SELECT key will popup a windows to let you confirm the NORFLASH MODE, A to YES, B to NO. The game wrote to the NORFLASH will be listed beside EZDISK folder. press A to launch it.

SAVE BACKUP
EZ-FLASH IV uses a SRAM chip to keep the game save data, the kernel will backup the save data every time when the kernel boot up, the backup procedure can be skiped by press L key when kernel booting up. The game saves are stored in a folder named SAVE on the SD card. Backup the folder to computer frequently is strongly recommended.

FOR ADVANCED USER
AUTO PATCH ENGINE(APE)
In EZ4kernel 2.00, APE (AUTO PATCH ENGINE) replaced the EZ4Client, you can copy the clean rom to SD card directly instead patching them one by one with EZ4Client.

A patch file will be generated at the game's first time launch, the patch files are stored in a folder named PATCH on SD card. They will be used in the next time launch and reduce loading time effectively.

Here is a benchmark table:

         APE 1st	  APE 2nd   1.78
32Mbit   27s       9s        16s
64Mbit   51s       18s       25s
128Mbit  100s      33s       52s

GLOBAL SOFTRESET AND SLEEP(GSS)
In EZ4Kernel 2.02, GLOBAL SOFTRESET AND SLEEP(GSS) was implemented. default softreset key combination is L + UP + B, default sleep key combination is L + R + START, default wake up key combination is START + SELECT.

Some games can not apply the GSS patch properly, you can use L+B to launch them without GSS patch.

If you want to set your own hotkey combination, there is a file named KEYSET.CFG in the EZ4Kernel 2.02 package. please check it out. This file must placed in the root of SD card.

HARDRESET
Some games with anti-piracy technolgy need a hardreset before launch, you can do it with press L+A, and you can set global hardreset launch with A only, by modify the KEYSET.CFG file in the above topic.
