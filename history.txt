* PCEAdvance now clears Super CD-ROM memory allowing multiple SCD titles to be played in a session without rebooting
* PCEAdvance builder script now automatically truncates oversized CD-ROM compilations - Akumajou Dracula X works now!

05-18-22 patters
* modified PCEAdvance binary to use EZ-Flash IV PSRAM for Super CD-ROM support and, in theory, Arcade CD-ROM but
  unfortunately PSRAM doesn't currently work when the emulator is launched from NOR flash - so titles larger than 16MB
  do not work (no Akumajou Dracula X yet)
* added Flubba's Murdoc emulator for Mr. Do!, exit patched and SRAM patched
* added bash versions of the Murdoc simple concatenation scripts

05-13-22 patters
* added Flubba's GhostsnGoblinsGBA emulator, exit patched and SRAM patched
* added Flubba's YieArKungFuGBA emulator, exit patched and SRAM patched
* added bash versions of the various simple concatenation scripts for these emulators

05-04-22 patters
* added Snezziboy emulator and new Python 3 compile script
* added a GBA title, and a GAME_ID of 'SNZI' to snezzi.gba which had blank header info
* builder script has verbose mode to provide the same output as the original snezzi.exe tool
* builder can only bundle a single ROM with each emulator instance, but multiple ROM files can be processed at once
* fixed issue where SNESAdvance would only apply the first patch from the SuperDAT to each ROM

* added build.sh and build.bat scripts to each emulator folder for easier batch rom conversions
* added exit-patched PCEAdvance 7.5 and a new compile script
* added SNESAdvance 0.1f (no emulator exit though) and a new compile script
* merged SNESAdvance update history information
* major rewrite of all Python 3 compile scripts, which are mostly at feature parity with the old Win32 GUI applications
* all compile scripts:
  - drag and drop a selection of ROMs onto the shell window after typing the script name, to easily add multiple ROMs
  - blank SRAM save file of the appropriate size can now be created automatically using the -sav option
  - GSS patch file for EZ-Flash IV firmware 2.x (to force 64KB SRAM saves) can now be created using the -pat option
  - patch file data is encoded within the script body - no external dependency
  - splash screen support
  - optional overrides of file paths
  - can clean brackets from ROM titles
* some compile scripts (as applicable):
  - auto-detection of ROM types for emulators that support multiple types with specific header requirements
  - region options and PAL timings are now auto-detected based on ROM naming
  - boot-to-BIOS support
  - small ROMs suitable for link transfer (<192KB) can be marked in the game list
* pceadvance_compile.py:
  - ISO and TCD tracklist support for PC Engine CD-ROM
  - some sprite follow settings for "Unscaled (Auto)" display mode (those featured in gamelist.txt)
  - CD BIOS automatically added when an ISO image is added, and titled with the ISO name
* goomba_compile.py:
  - works around an EZ-Flash issue where some ROMs would cause duplicate game list entries
  - can prefer ROM filenames rather than original ROM game titles in the game list
* pocketnes_compile.py:
  - can lookup ROM checksum in PocketNES Menu Maker database (pnesmmw.mdb) for optimal game settings, sprite follow
  - can prefer game titles from PocketNES Menu Maker database
  - 256 byte alignment of all ROM data for optimum performance
* snesadvance_compile.py:
  - SuperDAT database is mandatory (snesadvance.dat)
  - default graphics assets are encoded in the script, external skin files are ingested if present
  - can accept headered or unheadered ROMs (.smc/.sfc)
  - can export header-stripped ROMs
  - can prefer game titles from SuperDAT database
