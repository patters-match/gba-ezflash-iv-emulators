https://github.com/Dwedit/PocketNES/releases/tag/12-25-2019
   This build finally re-adds the Go Multiboot feature to let you eject the cartridge, and keep playing. Useful for link play.
   The ROM file must be under 196K. 256K games are also supported, as long as they are smaller than 196K once compressed.

   New PPU hack
   Fixed bugs
   "dirty tiles" system
   Changed version number from "9.99" to "X alpha 1"
   Separated NES OAM from GBA OAM, games which do not update the sprite table every frame no longer messed up when changing the screen position in unscaled mode.
   Synchronized CHR-RAM updates with sprite table updates, battletoads looks great
   Now correctly displays warning when SRAM is full at bootup
   All scanline-buffers synchronized together
   Fixed many instances of the dummy scanline being treated as the first visible scanline

V9.99 - 2008-03-18 (Dwedit)
https://www.dwedit.org/dwedit_board/viewtopic.php?id=345
   More speedups from using EWRAM to store rom pages (instead of reading them from the cartridge)
   Many savestate fixes
   Now uses correct identification for savestates created with compressed roms. Old savestates made with compressed roms will not work.
   Added in something developed a year ago and then I forgot to merge it in o_O (I thought it had been integrated in, but apparently it wasn't)
   Fixed cheats getting lost after loading state
   Fixed compressed VS games
   Some internal code changes to allow certain features to be excluded at build time

V9.99 - 2008-03-13 (Dwedit)

V9.99 - 2008-03-08 (Dwedit)
https://www.dwedit.org/dwedit_board/viewtopic.php?id=345

   Added the punchout hack back in
   Re-added PPU hack
   Re-added cheat finder
   Fixed a cheat finder bug (kept old cheats active after changing games)
   Fixed bug where savestates did not load correctly from previous alphas
   Changed IRQs for Mapper 69 [FME-7], (Mr. Gimmick, Return of the Joker...)
   Savestates now save sound information

V9.99 - 2007-07-16 (Dwedit)
https://www.dwedit.org/dwedit_board/viewtopic.php?id=312
   Palette updater fixed, no longer writes out of bounds
   Duck Tales Fix (supports changing 8x8 sprite origin between left and right pattern table per scanline)
   'Dirty tiles' system for CHR-RAM games
   Different code for updating the sprites
   These two together fix sprite glitches in Battletoads, Wizards and Warriors 3, and more.
   Also a buggy and broken dirty tile system for CHR-ROM games
   New per-scanline scrolling code fixes Slalom, horribly breaks Rad Racer
   Sprite visibility per-scanline buffer updated in sync with rest of buffers
   Fixed a little bug which caused harmless extraneous memory writes
   Yes it's really buggy.  Has a new 'new frame' system which fails in lots of games.

https://www.dcemu.co.uk/vbulletin/threads/39164-PocketNES-v9-99-Build-13-10-2006
    New version uploaded, fixes a stupid IRQ bug. This bug made "Hello Kitty no Ohanabatake" crash, and Dragon Quest briefly scroll to the wrong position for one frame when changing areas. 
    Really stupid bug. I was assuming RTI enabled interrupts. *pounds head against desk* Stupid Z80 experience and lack of 6502 experience...
